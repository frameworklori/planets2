_____

# Eight planets trace their paths, none vying for place;
# When humans keep their word and boundary, their hearts find peace.
# The order of the cosmos lies not in distance, 
# But in the gravity of sincerity that binds all things.
______

                                             write the prologue that remains unfinished, grateful for your presence.


## Moon — 
a presence visible to the human eye, seemingly within reach yet forever distant, symbolizing wholeness and perfection.

## stars- 
A single star, though as tiny as a grain of sand, shines with quiet devotion, offering its faint light. Gradually, through the laws of attraction and imitation, other stars draw near. Suddenly, countless stars fill the sky—an endless brilliance turning darkness into a continuous, firework-like glow.

## Mercury-
It looks like Earth—h
yet it is not our home.
So close to the Sun,
and still it cannot melt
your frostbound heart.
Cold,
beautiful,
a mirror that pretends warmth—
a planet that seems like home,
but never will be.

## Venus- 
So like my home, the Earth—
in shape, in silence, in the curve of its light.
Yet it lacks that dazzling shimmer
that dresses Earth in blue , Green and white
Venus stays veiled
in a single, blinding gold—
monotone, eternal,
so bright
that no one can look for long.

## Earth-
Eternal, profound homeland of love—
no one could ever take your place in my heart.
I’m sorry—
for the selfish way we’ve ignored your pain,
for taking without end,
for plundering what was never ours to own.
Knowing you are ill,
yet powerless to shield you—
such helpless sorrow.
Please…
grant us a little more time,
a little more chance
to make things right again.


## Mars-
No radiant beauty adorns your face—
all is buried beneath dust and rust-red plains.
Yet you have become
the  Noah's Ark of humankind,
the vessel of our desperate voyage—
to keep the flame alive,
to carry the last breath
of a fading civilization.
## For Those Who Favor Mars

• You carry a bold spirit of adventure
• Courageous and driven to win
• Always eager to conquer the unknown

But sometimes, you forget to look back at yourself.
If humanity does not change its own flaws,
then even a new planet won’t save us.

We would only repeat the same mistakes,
again and again — an endless cycle.

So ask yourself:
How many Mars do we have left to call home?

## Jupiter-
he illusion of Authority
In the far reaches of the solar system,
a colossal world turns in silence-
the largest of all planets, 
a monarch of gas and storm,
known to humankind as Jupiter, lord of the gods.
its body has no bones, 
only drifting clouds of hydrogen and helium,
churning under endless pressure.
Heat rises from within, 
entwining with the cold from above=
their clash weavingribbons of eternal wind.
white as frost, brown and bronze,
those belts of air are like the robes of a sky-king
wrapping the entire sphere
into a marble of patterns withour substance.



## Saturn-
The planet of Boundaries, it is the monarch of moons within the solar realm, 
yet bound tightly by its own radiant rings.
Those interlocking halos,
Chains of time themselves,
Encircle a kingdom with no ground to stand upon.
There,
Radiation speaks as judgment,
And coldness reigns as the price of order.
Saturn wears distance as its dignity, 
And solitude as its crown,
its beauty endures by keeping distance;
its uniqueness lies beneath the radiant rings.

## Uranus-  
The Planet of Elsa
At the edge of the Solar Sea,
drifts a blue, tilted world —
spinning sideways, defying every rule of motion.
Her name is Elsa,
a self never accepted by the crowd,
forced to bury warmth beneath the shadow of fear.
Yet when she let herself go,
when the wind and snow began to sing —
she found freedom.
Let it go.
Beneath the cold auroras of Uranus,
there is no fear of the masses,
no bondage of warmth.
Only freedom.
Only solitude.
Only the eternal blue,
refracted through the light.

## For You, Who Prefer Uranus Over All Others 
- You are drawn to uniqueness and to things that are beautifully different.
Yet inside, you carry a quiet loneliness —
often overlooked, often misunderstood,
always keeping yourself low-key.
But deep within you lives a soft,
undeniable romance that never fades.
You stand out because when the world looks to Mars,
you choose Uranus instead.

## Neptune – Lord of the Sea

Color of the Sea,
An unreachable deep blue—
serene yet unfathomable,
where those who draw near
can only gaze at your shadow
rippled upon the surface.

Diamond Rain is grievance under pressure.
In the depths of your high-pressured soul,
you compress pain into light,
each drop falling
and crystallizing into a heart
that still shines after cooling.

The Eye of the Storm,
the vortex of your consciousness and soul—
there the tempests never rest,
spinning in solitude,
where the world’s most silent place
conceals its greatest power.

You, the deep-blue one,
embody the awareness that longs for freedom.
Within your swirling blue, you raise the storm,
your cold distance turning all away.

Diamond tears—
your own liberation,
your way to release emotion,
to hide the truth of a heart too hot to bear.
The world calls you cold,
yet you only wish to keep them
from seeing the ceaseless fire
that burns beneath the sea.

## Pluto

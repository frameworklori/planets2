# write the prologue that remains unfinished, grateful for your presence.

Moon — a presence visible to the human eye, seemingly within reach yet forever distant, symbolizing wholeness and perfection.

stars- A single star, though as tiny as a grain of sand, shines with quiet devotion, offering its faint light. Gradually, through the laws of attraction and imitation, other stars draw near. Suddenly, countless stars fill the sky—an endless brilliance turning darkness into a continuous, firework-like glow.

Mercury-
It looks like Earth—
yet it is not our home.
So close to the Sun,
and still it cannot melt
your frostbound heart.
Cold,
beautiful,
a mirror that pretends warmth—
a planet that seems like home,
but never will be.

Venus- 
So like my home, the Earth—
in shape, in silence, in the curve of its light.
Yet it lacks that dazzling shimmer
that dresses Earth in blue , Green and white
Venus stays veiled
in a single, blinding gold—
monotone, eternal,
so bright
that no one can look for long.

Earth-
Eternal, profound homeland of love—
no one could ever take your place in my heart.
I’m sorry—
for the selfish way we’ve ignored your pain,
for taking without end,
for plundering what was never ours to own.
Knowing you are ill,
yet powerless to shield you—
such helpless sorrow.
Please…
grant us a little more time,
a little more chance
to make things right again.


Mars-
No radiant beauty adorns your face—
all is buried beneath dust and rust-red plains.
Yet you have become
the  Noah's Ark of humankind,
the vessel of our desperate voyage—
to keep the flame alive,
to carry the last breath
of a fading civilization.

write the prologue that remains unfinished, grateful for your presence.

Moon — a presence visible to the human eye, seemingly within reach yet forever distant, symbolizing wholeness and perfection.

stars- A single star, though as tiny as a grain of sand, shines with quiet devotion, offering its faint light. Gradually, through the laws of attraction and imitation, other stars draw near. Suddenly, countless stars fill the sky—an endless brilliance turning darkness into a continuous, firework-like glow.

Mercury-
It looks like Earth—
yet it is not our home.
So close to the Sun,
and still it cannot melt
your frostbound heart.
Cold,
beautiful,
a mirror that pretends warmth—
a planet that seems like home,
but never will be.

Venus- 
So like my home, the Earth—
in shape, in silence, in the curve of its light.
Yet it lacks that dazzling shimmer
that dresses Earth in blue and white.
Venus stays veiled
in a single, blinding gold—
monotone, eternal,
so bright
that no one can look for long.

Earth-

Mars
Jupiter
Saturn
Uranus is both awesome and terrible!
Neptune
Pluto
